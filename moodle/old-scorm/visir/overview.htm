<h1 id="toc0"> OpenLabs Electronics Laboratory</h1>

<h2 id="toc1"> Open your electronics laboratories for remote experimentation</h2>
<p>The Internet provides new possibilities for universities and other 
teaching organizations to share laboratories equipped with expensive 
instruments. Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH) in Sweden has 
created a lab workbench equipped with a unique remote control interface,
 enabling students to perform physical experiments at home or elsewhere.
 For example, they can practise before regular lab sessions. Remote 
experimentation supplements face-to-face sessions. Off campus students 
can participate in supervised sessions using teleconferencing tools.</p>


<h2 id="toc2"> Invitation</h2>
<p>A project, VISIR (Virtual Instrument Systems In Reality), has been 
started to disseminate methods to open laboratories for remote 
experimentation. This is an invitation to</p>

<ul>
    <li>join the VISIR Community</li>
    <li>set up a VISIR workbench for electrical experiments </li>
    <li>participate in the further development of this VISIR Lab Platform </li>
</ul>

<p>It is an opportunity of providing students with free experimentation 
resources 24/7 without substantial increase in cost per student. 
Spending more time on experiments your students will become true 
experimenters being able to design goods and services complying with the
 requirements of a sustainable society. FH Campus Vienna in Austria and 
University of Deusto in Spain have set up VISIR workbenches and use them
 in their own lab courses. The VISIR software is released under a GNU 
GPL license. The instruments and LabVIEW, which is also required, can be
 bought from National Instruments. The telemanipulator needed for 
circuit wiring is commercially available as well. Please contact <a href="mailto:ingvar.gustavsson@bth.se">Ingvar Gustavsson</a> for more information.</p>


<h2 id="toc3"> Many students can perform physical experiments simultaneously</h2>
<p>The workbench is equipped with a unique virtual interface enabling 
students to recognize the desktop instruments and the breadboard they 
have already used in the local laboratory on their own computer screen. 
The physical breadboard, widely used in electronics laboratories, cannot
 be controlled remotely. It has been replaced by a telemanipulator, i.e.
 a switching relay matrix, which the student can control by wiring on a 
virtual breadboard. This breadboard and an example of a virtual 
instrument front panel displayed on a student&#8217;s computer screen are 
shown in the figures below. When the user has made all wiring and 
setting of the instruments she presses the <em>Perform Experiment</em> 
button to send them to the workbench, which creates the desired circuit 
and performs the experiment in fractions of a second. The result is 
returned to the user. A timesharing scheme allows many users to 
experiment simultaneously i.e. the workbench is equivalent of a 
laboratory equipped with many traditional workbenches. The VISIR Lab 
Platform is presented in many scientific papers. (<a href="http://www.online-journals.org/index.php/i-joe/article/viewFile/504/412" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;">One example</a>)</p>


<h2 id="toc4"> Only a web browser is required</h2>
<p>Only Internet access and a web browser with a Flash player are 
required to access the experimental resources. The client software is 
automatically downloaded from a web server. The equipment provided 
comprises a dual channel oscilloscope, a function generator, a DMM, a 
triple DC power supply, the switching relay matrix, and a number of 
components such as resistors, IC circuits etc. installed in the matrix. 
As in a local laboratory session, every student is provided with a set 
of components in each lab session. The set is displayed in a component 
box on the top of the virtual breadboard. The BTH electronics workbench 
can be found at <a href="http://openlabs.bth.se/electronics" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;">http://openlabs.bth.se/electronics</a> and is open for guest users to try out.</p>
