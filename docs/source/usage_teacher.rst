A teacher needs a SCORM object per laboratory. So as to gather it, the LMS
administrator needs to provide the SCORM object to the teacher. The teacher can
optionally modify it (adding laboratory information, course information, etc.).
Then, the teacher can upload it as a SCORM object to a particular week, make it
visible for students, etc.

So, granted that the LMS administrator has sent a SCORM object to the teacher:

From that point, the SCORM object is just another SCORM object:

And whenever a student enrolled in that course opens the SCORM object, a
reservation will be performed, and the student can open the reservation:
