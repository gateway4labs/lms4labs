Vocabulary
==========

This section just defines the terms used in this documentation. These terms
should be updated so as to fill the `GOLC <http://www.online-lab.org>`_
terminology, and whenever they are changed, the whole document should change.
So as to start with something, we'll define a basic set of concepts, sorted
alphabetically:

.. glossary::

  Laboratory
     A laboratory represents the conceptual place where students will go to use
     an assigned physical equipment. If students wants to access a *Robot
     laboratory*, they'll request that laboratory and whenever they can access
     (after booking or queueing), they'll start using a particular copy of it
     (called Rig, and its definition is outside the scope of this document).

  Learning Management System (LMS)
     It is a software application for the administration, documentation,
     tracking, and reporting of training programs, classroom and online events,
     e-learning programs, and training content.  Extracted from the `wikipedia
     <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system>`_.  Examples:
     `Moodle <http://www.moodle.org>`_, `.LRN <http://www.dotlrn.org/>`_, `ilias
     <http://www.ilias.de/>`_, etc.

  Remote Laboratory Management System (RLMS) 
     Management software system that manages different remote laboratories. A
     RLMS can support multiple remote laboratories (such as a *Robot laboratory*
     and an *Electronics laboratory* at the same time). RLMSs provide
     authentication, authorization, user management, user tracking, and
     scheduling, as well as APIs to develop new laboratories on top of them.
